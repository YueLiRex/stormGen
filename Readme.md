# StomGen
## What is StormGen ?

StomGen is a load test tool for message broker. It now only supports Kafka. It will support more message broker in the future. For example Pulsar, Mqtt, RocketMQ are planed to support.

## Motivation

When I try to find some stress testing tools for my kafka consumer application, I can't really find a one really meet my requirements.
Then I decide to write a one.

## Current progress

The project is still in the development.

## How to use ?

Because now the project is still in the development.
If you want to play with current version, clone the project to your local and look at ExampleScenario.scala
